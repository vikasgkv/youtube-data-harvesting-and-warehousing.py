Harvesting YouTube data and warehousing it involves interacting with the YouTube API to fetch relevant information like channel_id,views count,likes count etc and storing it in a database . Here, I am using Python and the google-api-python-client library for interacting with the YouTube API.
Additionally, i used mongodb, MYSQL as  databases for warehousing the data.
along with that i am using streamlit library to make intractive web page for the user
